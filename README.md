# 👋 Hi, I’m [Your Name]

I’m a **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** working within **Data Engineering** at a **London-based bank**.  
I specialise in building **secure, scalable cloud platforms** and **automated CI/CD pipelines** that enable data teams to deliver reliably in highly regulated environments.

I come from a **Civil Engineering** background, with professional experience in **Information Management** and **Digital Delivery**—a foundation that shaped my systems thinking, documentation standards, and delivery-first mindset.

## 💼 What I Do

- Design and maintain **cloud infrastructure** for enterprise data platforms  
- Implement **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform  
- Build and support **CI/CD pipelines** using Azure DevOps (YAML)  
- Enable analytics and reporting through **well-governed cloud platforms**  
- Collaborate closely with data engineers, analysts, and stakeholders  

A significant part of my role involves working in **globally distributed teams**, collaborating daily with colleagues based in:
- 🇬🇧 **London**
- 🇺🇸 **United States**
- 🇮🇳 **India**

This has strengthened my experience in **cross-time-zone delivery**, clear technical communication, and operating effectively in large, international engineering organisations.

## 🌍 Languages

- 🇬🇧 **English** — Professional fluency  
- 🇩🇪 **German** — Professional fluency  

Comfortable working in multilingual, international environments.
